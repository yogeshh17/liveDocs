LiveDocs is a collaborative text editor built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Liveblocks** for real-time functionality.

üéì **Learning by Building** ‚Äì This project was developed step-by-step to deepen understanding of full-stack development, real-time collaboration, and modern frameworks like Next.js and Liveblocks.

The goal of this project was to replicate core features of Google Docs while learning about authentication, document management, and live collaboration in a production-like setup.
